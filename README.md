## Minimum Viable Product
Flux-capacitr is a clone of Tumblr built on Rails and Backbone. Users can:

* Create blog posts with tags
* View blogs and posts
* Subscribe to blogs
* View a feed of subscribed blogs
* Search for blogs by title
* Search for posts by tag

## Design Docs
* DB schema
* Core views

## Implementation Timeline

### Phase 1: User Authentication, Basic Blogs and Posts (~1 day)
I will implement user authentication in Rails based on the practices learned at
App Academy. By the end of this phase, users will be able to create blogs and
posts using simple text forms in Rails views. The most important part of this
phase will be pushing the app to Heroku and ensuring that everything works
before moving on to phase 2.

### Phase 2: JSON API and First Backbone Views (~1 day)
I will add API routes to serve blog and post data as JSON, then add Backbone
models and collections that fetch data from those routes. By the end of this
phase, I will have the following rudimentary Backbone views:

* `BlogShow`
* `BlogForm`
* `PostShow`
* `PostForm`

### Phase 3 (estimated time)

### Phase 5 (estimated time)
